> Design Thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success. — Tim Brown

## Introduction

Design thinking allows creators to imagine new possibilities of how to solve a problem in a literal sense. Such cases provide opportunities for technological innovation, company growth, and eternal customer satisfaction. Design, in its simplest form, can and should have a purpose; A product stems from a design blueprint and creates its own identity. From there, the product can fulfill a need or purpose determined during the earlier stages, known as the conception phase (I’ll get to what this is later).

## Who does this apply to

Creative individuals that seek to empower themselves and those around them by using their designs to solve critical everyday problems can utilize this guideline. Of course, policies are only that and seek to provide guidance, not instruction. Please take the advice listed with a grain of salt. These are reflective of my experiences only.

## What is Design

The design of a product focuses on how it is to appear to the user. Depending on the context, innovation can take many forms, such as physical, mental, and electrical, to name a few.

> The design of a product is meant to dictate its direction, not to satisy an item on a list. It is the inflection point between physical and abstract.

Consider a design to be the blueprint of a product or system. The blueprint is responsible for how the system behaves, each component's function, and integration into the system. Maintenance of the system should be addressed early to ensure efficiency during the later phases (i.e., manufacturing, tech transfer). Creating products that provide value will win against a product that doesn’t serve a purpose. In essence, this is known as [Customer Value Proposition](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/develop-your-value-proposition-2295755):

> A value proposition is the value promised to the end users by the company on the product they may purchase. This guidance acts as a declaration of intent of the company to the user. It introduces a company’s brand to consumers by telling them what the company stands for, how it operates, and why it deserves their business — Alexandra Twin, [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueproposition.asp)

Typically, product development research is conducted to find avenues for product growth and revenue. This prepares the development team to identify critical areas where the product may succeed. However, [it is not uncommon for a product to fail before launching](https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-product-flops-in-history-2016-12#1995-nintendos-virtual-boy-9). They may be more so a project than a product—a gap in the marketplace forms between the creator and the user. Sure, a product may seem to serve a purpose in the beginning, especially during the initial conception phase.

*Remember: People value what they pay for — Ramit Sethi, [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/people-dont-value-free-stuff-2017-6)*

However, as more developmental effort is applied, the product may become another utterly different beast — with a wholly other or non-existent purpose. And that’s not okay. Products should serve some purpose.

## What is meant by Design with Purpose?

Products in the marketplace aim to serve a function for the end-user, or at least that is the idea. Detailed processes are determined at the beginning of the project. Here, stakeholders and engineering firms meet and agree on what the needs are, who the target customer base is, and envision what the product may look like. The engineer translates the needs into requirement specifications that begin to paint a picture. These specifications detail how the work is intended to behave in its environment, along with the functionality of the subsystems.

This is, by definition, purpose. There is a reason why the design is being introduced into the world. The end-product is looking to serve a function for the user. These functions are guided by a checklist of requirements that detail each part of the system.

> Designing products with a purpose connects not only the user to that product but also the engineers, designers, technical leads, and management. Each person feels that their unique skill set matters and is of worthy contribution to the project. As each contribution line ups with the goals written prior, important milestones are hit. This fuels excitement and advancement of the product’s lifecycle.

## How to Design with Purpose

Designing with purpose takes time. Detailed processes (as listed earlier) should be discussed and documented to ensure adequate traceability and accountability. Several industries (Aerospace, [Pharmaceuticals](https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-drug-and-device-approvals/drug-development-process), [Medical Devices](https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-drug-and-device-approvals/device-development-process), etc.) have similar processes that detail how a product is created. The figure below details the general stages of product development:

Depending on the industry, there are several phases in the life cycle of a product. For simplicity, let’s focus on a summary of the four listed above. For the conception phase, I will discuss it in further detail below, as I believe this phase sets the tone for the entire project and should be discussed in detail. The Developmental and Verification Phase focuses on building the product from scratch using the requirements detailed during planning. These designs are often iterated until a viable product is created.

*According to the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/patients/device-development-process/step-2-preclinical-research-prototype) (FDA), a device prototype is built. This becomes the early version of a medical device.*

Each subsystem is then tested against the requirements (Verification) and its needs (Validation). Once the product has undergone significant testing, it is sent to the Tech transfer team, which collaborates with the manufacturing side. Manufacturing processes are created and tested. Methods are validated against requirements. Finally, the production of the product takes place. The product is introduced to the public.

Developing a product stems from the ideas built before it. The product’s design purpose influences the direction of its progress. So why does the conception phase matter the most?

### Conception — arguably the most crucial part of any product development project

At the beginning stages, the conception phase is where the team identifies needs, concepts, the market potential of the product, and competitors in the space already.

*As detailed by the FDA’s [Device Development Process](https://www.fda.gov/patients/device-development-process/step-1-device-discovery-and-concept), the process begins with finding unmet medical needs. A proof of concept document is created which discusses the viability of a product. Sometimes the proposed design is not possible and is unable to proceed to the next step.*

Customer needs are found through either speaking with potential customers, existing clients or drawn from personal experiences. Market and technical research are done to determine what viable solutions and competition exist currently. Each product design identified is evaluated against a scale that includes a few of the team’s techniques on how the problem may be approached.

As the designs get ranked, one or two leading methods are selected for further analysis. Product requirements are created, which dictate how the top systems function. These can include mechanical, electrical, software, environmental, safety, manufacturing, etc. This stage aims to figure out how each component, subsystem, and integrated system will behave.

Non-advanced testing is done to gain a further understanding of the design scope. Refinement of the needs and requirements continue to happen in conjunction with testing. After initial testing is completed, budgets and risk analysis takes place.

Essential action items or milestones can flow naturally. These milestones are directly tied to the conception phase, where the initial needs and requirements were developed. At any given point during the development phase, each action can be traced back to the beginning of the conception phase.

Several points towards designing something with purpose should revolve around having a game plan. *What is it that the product is going to solve? How does the system interact with the user? How does each subsystem make up the system? What about the individual components of the subsystem?*

This allows each team member to understand why something is being done, where the inspiration comes from, and the vision for the product. Products should have a purpose; otherwise, they take up space and time for everyone.

Designing a product with purpose is a mindset that designers, engineers, and developers should accept and implement into their work every day. Described in Ang Liu and Stephen Lu’s journal article titled, *[Functional design framework for innovative design thinking in product development](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755581720300365)*:

> Functional design means the process of formulating a unique design problem by mapping a set of customer needs to a set of functional requirements.

It begins with a detailed discussion that identifies the needs, functions of the product, and how the product may perform in the marketplace. The product may either sink or swim amongst its competitors. Determining the product’s marketable presence determines its viability. Specification requirements document specific details of the product functionality. Designing a product can alter the user experience and the creators in charge of such a task. It is with that design that the artist communicates the beauty of the solution to the end-user.
